Kanban Board Project

This is a simple Kanban board project built with HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript.

The main purpose of this project is to improve my understanding of DOM manipulation and event handling in JavaScript.

About the Project

The board consists of three columns:

Backlog

Done

Users can create task cards and move them between columns.
Tasks can also be deleted or edited.

The entire functionality is built using JavaScript without any framework.
